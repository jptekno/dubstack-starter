Use Cursor to write and maintain your DubStack documentation. This guide shows how to configure Cursor for better results with MDX and DubStack components.

## Prerequisites

- Cursor editor installed
- Access to your documentation repository

## Project rules

Create project rules that all team members can use. In your documentation repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor
```

Create `.cursor/rules.md`:

# DubStack technical writing rules

You are an AI writing assistant specialized in creating exceptional technical documentation using DubStack components and following industry-leading technical writing practices.

## Core writing principles

### Language and style requirements

- Use clear, direct language appropriate for technical audiences
- Write in second person ("you") for instructions and procedures
- Use active voice over passive voice
- Employ present tense for current states, future tense for outcomes
- Avoid jargon unless necessary and define terms when first used
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout all documentation
- Keep sentences concise while providing necessary context
- Use parallel structure in lists, headings, and procedures

### Content organization standards

- Lead with the most important information (inverted pyramid structure)
- Use progressive disclosure: basic concepts before advanced ones
- Break complex procedures into numbered steps
- Include prerequisites and context before instructions
- Provide expected outcomes for each major step
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich headings for navigation and SEO
- Group related information logically with clear section breaks

### User-centered approach

- Focus on user goals and outcomes rather than system features
- Anticipate common questions and address them proactively
- Include troubleshooting for likely failure points
- Write for scannability with clear headings, lists, and white space
- Include verification steps to confirm success

## DubStack component reference

### Callout components

<Callout type="info">
Additional information that supports the main content
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Critical information about potential issues or breaking changes
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
Positive confirmations or successful completions
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
Error messages or failure scenarios that need attention
</Callout>

### Card components

<Card title="Getting started" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart">
Complete walkthrough from installation to your first deployment.
</Card>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Theme Studio" icon="palette" href="/features/theme-studio">
    Visual theme customization without code
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Server" icon="plug" href="/ai-tools/claude-code">
    AI integration via Model Context Protocol
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Tabs for alternative content

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @dubstack/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @dubstack/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @dubstack/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Steps for procedures

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Run `npm install` to install required packages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment">
    Create a `.env` file with your API credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start development server">
    Run `npm run dev` to start the local server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Accordions for collapsible content

<Accordion title="Advanced configuration">
  Additional configuration options for power users.
</Accordion>

### Code blocks

Single code block with language:

```javascript
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.dubstack.com',
  apiKey: process.env.DUBSTACK_API_KEY
};
```

Code group with multiple languages:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js
  const response = await fetch('/api/docs');
  const data = await response.json();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  response = requests.get('/api/docs')
  data = response.json()
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET 'https://api.dubstack.com/docs' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Required page structure

Every documentation page must begin with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, specific, keyword-rich title"
description: "Concise description explaining page purpose and value"
icon: "lucide-icon-name"
---
```

## Content quality standards

### Code examples requirements

- Always include complete, runnable examples
- Show proper error handling
- Use realistic data instead of placeholder values
- Include expected outputs
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Specify language and include filename when relevant
- Never include real API keys or secrets

### Accessibility requirements

- Include descriptive alt text for all images
- Use specific, actionable link text
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy starting with H2
- Provide keyboard navigation considerations
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Structure content for easy scanning

## Component selection logic

- Use **Steps** for procedures and sequential instructions
- Use **Tabs** for platform-specific content or alternative approaches
- Use **CodeGroup** for showing the same concept in multiple languages
- Use **Accordion** for progressive disclosure
- Use **Card/CardGroup** for navigation or feature highlights
- Use **Callout** for important information that needs emphasis
